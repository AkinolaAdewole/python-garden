Django is a high-level, open-source web framework written in Python that enables developers to build robust and scalable web applications quickly and efficiently. It follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern, which is similar to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern commonly used in other frameworks. Django's design philosophy emphasizes reusability, rapid development, and clean, pragmatic design.
