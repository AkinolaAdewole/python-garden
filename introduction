Python is a key language in data engineering because of its ability to process, transform, and analyze large datasets efficiently. 
Hereâ€™s how Python is used in data engineering:

1. Data Extraction (ETL - Extract, Transform, Load)
Python helps in extracting data from multiple sources like:
âœ… Databases â€“ MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB (using libraries like SQLAlchemy, psycopg2, PyMongo)
âœ… APIs & Web Scraping â€“ REST APIs, Web Scraping (requests, BeautifulSoup, Scrapy)
âœ… Cloud Storage & Big Data â€“ AWS S3, Google BigQuery, Hadoop

2. Data Transformation & Cleaning
Python is excellent for processing and transforming raw data into structured formats.
âœ… Pandas â€“ Handles tabular data, filtering, and aggregation
âœ… Dask â€“ Scales Pandas for big data
âœ… PySpark â€“ Processes large datasets using Apache Spark

3. Data Pipeline Automation
âœ… Apache Airflow â€“ Schedules and automates workflows
âœ… Luigi â€“ Manages dependencies in ETL workflows
âœ… Dagster â€“ Modern data pipeline orchestration

4. Data Storage & Loading
âœ… Database Interaction â€“ SQL (sqlite3, SQLAlchemy)
âœ… Big Data Technologies â€“ Hadoop, Spark, Kafka
âœ… Cloud Integration â€“ AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage

5. Data Processing & Performance Optimization
âœ… NumPy â€“ Fast numerical computations
âœ… Modin â€“ Speeds up Pandas for large datasets
âœ… Vaex â€“ Handles billions of rows efficiently
